# Series Sequence Program Documentation

## Introduction

The Series Sequence Program is designed to generate arithmetic and geometric sequences based on user input and verify if the user correctly identifies the common difference and common ratio, respectively.

## Main Function

- This function is the entry point of the program.
- It prompts the user to enter an expected number for the arithmetic sequence.
- It generates the arithmetic sequence starting from the entered number and incrementing by 3 until reaching 50.
- It then prompts the user to enter the common difference of the sequence and verifies if the user's input matches the correct common difference.
- Next, it prompts the user to enter a number for the geometric sequence.
- It generates the geometric sequence starting from the entered number and doubling it until reaching 100.
- It finally prompts the user to enter the common ratio of the sequence and verifies if the user's input matches the correct common ratio.
- The program repeats the above steps in an infinite loop using the `goto` statement.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the prompts to enter the expected number, common difference, and common ratio for each sequence.
4. The program will inform if the user's inputs are correct or incorrect.
5. The program will continue running in an infinite loop until manually terminated.

## Example

This documentation provides an overview of the code structure, functionality, usage instructions, and example output.
